# Learning about wsclean: library for tratement of radioastronomy images
## Instalation:
Exploring two ways in Ubuntu:
- 1- With ``sudo apt install wsclean``. It downloads wsclean in version 3.0.
- 2- Manually, following steps in [wsclean](https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). First, clone the repository with ``git clone -b master git@gitlab.com:aroffringa/wsclean.git``. Then, install all dependencies as the web indicates, like Casacore, fftw,... -->Maybe HDF5 causes troubles.
