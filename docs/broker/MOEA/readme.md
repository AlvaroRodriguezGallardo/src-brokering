Here I will be uploading some programs and ideas can be used to implement MOEA. I have to model the problem, so ideas are:

- Creating a script in which I interpolate some inputs with some outputs (necessarily, it must exist a bijection between them). I have programmed a script, which generalizes the vectorial field dimensions, but input and output are randoms in this step (for real approximation I need real data). IT IS DONE.
- Creating a script in which I use a n-dimensional normal and, with some inputs and outputs, deduct a regression curve. Maybe it is a harder option, I need to read more about that (about n-dimensional gaussian function, libreries in Python,...)
